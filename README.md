## Project Setup

1. Clone
```powershell
mkdir my-project          <# Create a project folder.          #>
cd my-project             <# Go to your project directory.     #>
git clone                 <# clone the boilerplate files       #> `
    --recurse-submodules  <# including submodules              #> `
    "https://github.com/jzbradley/electron-react-webpack-boilerplate"
```

2. Install dependencies
```powershell
npm i
```

3. Test run
```powershell
npm run start
```

If you encounter the following error
```
App threw an error during load
node_modules/electron/dist/resources/default_app.asar/main.js:113
Error: Cannot find module '@misc/window/titlebarIPC.js'
```
ensure that git has initialized the *submodules*.

4. Check code.
```powershell
npm run lint
```

## Features Included

### React.js
[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a component oriented UI framework. It provides a meants of writing templated HTML from within javascript.
You'll notice that there are several .jsx files in the src folder, which use a specialized version of javascript's syntax which allows you to define your own elements.

This allows you to break the UI down into a repeatable *Component Heirarchy* (see also "[Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)")

```jsx
class KeyButton extends React.Component {
 render() {
   return (
     <button className="square" onClick={() => console.log(this.props.value)}>
       {this.props.value}
     </button>
   );
 }
}
class KeyPad extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
        <table>
        <tr> <td><KeyButton value={7}  /></td> <td><KeyButton value={8}/></td> <td><KeyButton value={9}  /></td> </tr>
        <tr> <td><KeyButton value={4}  /></td> <td><KeyButton value={5}/></td> <td><KeyButton value={6}  /></td> </tr>
        <tr> <td><KeyButton value={1}  /></td> <td><KeyButton value={2}/></td> <td><KeyButton value={3}  /></td> </tr>
        <tr> <td><KeyButton value={"*"}/></td> <td><KeyButton value={0}/></td> <td><KeyButton value={"#"}/></td> </tr>
        </table>
    );
  }
}

```
### Less
[Less](https://lesscss.org/#overview) (which stands for *Leaner Style Sheets*) is a language extension for CSS. Less is translated into CSS.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) set visual properties that determine how HTML is rendered, but it tends to require a lot of reptetition.

Less provides the following features to help make the CSS less redundant:
- [Variables](https://lesscss.org/#variables)
- [Mixins](https://lesscss.org/#mixins)
- [Nesting](https://lesscss.org/#nesting)
- [Operations](https://lesscss.org/#operations)
- [Escaping](https://lesscss.org/#escaping)
- [Functions](https://lesscss.org/#functions)
- [Namespaces and Accessors](https://lesscss.org/#namespaces-and-accessors)
- [Maps](https://lesscss.org/#maps)
- [Scope](https://lesscss.org/#scope)
- [Comments](https://lesscss.org/#comments)
- [Importing](https://lesscss.org/#importing)

### Webpack
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is a static module bundler. Any time one file depends on another, webpack treats this as a dependency. This allows webpack to take non-code assets, such as images or web fonts, and also provide them as dependencies for your application. When webpack processes your application, it starts from a list of modules defined on the command line or in its configuration file. Starting from these entry points, webpack recursively builds a dependency graph that includes every module your application needs, then bundles all of those modules into a small number of bundles - often, only one - to be loaded by the browser.

### Electron Forge
[Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io) provides an easy way of building and configuring your packaged application with platform specific distributables like DMG, EXE, or Flatpak files.
This configurations file is available in [tools/forge/forge.config.js](tools/forge/forge.config.js)

For further information, you can visit [Electron Forge Configuration](https://www.electronforge.io/configuration)

- *Package* your Electron app with OS-specific bundles (.app, .exe etc)
```bash
npm run package
```
- *Making* is a way of taking your packaged application and making platform specific distributables like DMG, EXE, or Flatpak files (amongst others).
```bash
npm run make
```
- *Publishing* is a way of taking the artifacts generated by the `make` command and sending them to a service somewhere for you to distribute or use as updates, such as an update server or an S3 bucket.
```bash
npm run publish
```
